# Genetic-Algorithm

## Preview of the project
In this project i will development different genetic algorithm that allow us to solve some basic problem.
Most of the time, the genetic algorithms are used to solve optimization problems.

## To-do list
- [ ] finish Creature.h abstract struct
- [ ] finish a functional Algorithm class

## Usefull command line
Use the following command to compile the code on Windows
```
g++ main.cpp Algorithm.cpp
```
